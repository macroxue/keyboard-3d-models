# keyboard-3d-models

These are keyboard models in OpenSCAD. All models assume Cherry MX switches or
its clones.

The newly added GengYun model is part of this split, ortholinear and contoured
DIY keyboard. See [Deskthority](https://deskthority.net/workshop-f7/gengyun-my-2nd-build-of-an-ortholinear-split-and-contoured-keyboard-t15704.html) for more descriptions and discussions
